/* Note:
An "enum" type is a special data type that enables for a variable to be a set of predefined constants. The variable must be equal to one of the values that have been predefined for it.

We implementing  "isStaff" it's because when we submit a ticket it's gonna be from the user or our site (admin) or from the "staff" (A staff portal is a website used to give members of staff access to important information. A staff portal is usually private and only available on internal networks. They might also be designed for access from an Internet-enabled computer from anywhere for the sake of convenience. To get access to the staff portal, people generally require a username and password assigned by the companyâ€™s IT department. A variety of information can be kept in staff portals, which can range from employee manuals to up-to-date information on contributions to benefits plans).
